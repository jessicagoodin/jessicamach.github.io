      <h3>Who is Brian Dawkins?</h3>
      <p>Brian Dawkins, like Wolverine, is a Superhero. Maybe not in the literal sense, but rather, in the way that he carries himself. The way that he shows his love for his family, God and the game. He is without a doubt, a brave and great human being. He is "a class act."</p>

A trigger that will have positive ripple effects on families and ultimately, on entire communities.</p>

      <h3>Football Legacy</h3>
      <p>Over the span of his career, Dawkins developed a reputation as a ball-hawking safety and became the unquestioned leader of the Philadelphia Eagles' defense. He earned the nickname "Weapon X," a codename of Marvel character Wolverine, the comic book superhero known for relentless aggression. He emerged as one of the top safeties in the league and was a defensive captain for the majority for both the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos. Dawkins is considered to be one of the top safeties in NFL history and was ranked as the fifth best safety in NFL history.</p>
